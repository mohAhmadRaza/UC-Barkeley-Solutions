# UC-BARKELY SOLUTION: REMIX-24 Contest Problem Bank Solutions

This repository contains the solutions for the 3 REMIX-24 contest problems and remaining are the solutions of problems for CALICO-24 actual competition. The solutions are provided based on the input-output pairings given in the files `inputs.txt` and `output.txt`. This repo follows the official pattern/template provided by CALICI.

## Repository Structure

- `inputs.txt`: Contains the input data for each problem in the REMIX-24 contest. These inputs are used for judging the correctness of the solutions.
- `output.txt`: Contains the correct output corresponding to the inputs in `inputs.txt`. This output is used to verify the accuracy of the solutions.
- `solution_files/`: Directory containing the solution code files for each problem in the contest. Each file corresponds to a specific problem's solution.
  
## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohAhmadRaza/UC-Barkeley-Solutions.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd uc-barkely-solution
   ```

3. Review the `inputs.txt` file to see all the inputs on which the problem will be judged.
4. Check the `output.txt` file to verify the expected output corresponding to the inputs.
5. Access the solution files in the `solution_files/` folder to view or modify the code for each problem.

## How to Run

1. To test the solution for any problem:
   - Take an input from `inputs.txt` or provide a new input.
   - Run the appropriate solution file for the problem.
   - Compare the output of the program with the expected output from `output.txt`.

2. If you're contributing to this repository, please ensure your solution follows the format and guidelines as provided in the official CALICI template.
